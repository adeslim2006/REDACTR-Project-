# REDACTR-Project-

> My name is Salim Morenigbade and i did this Redactr word scrambling project as my personal assessment project for the Devcareer program's secodn month assessment.

> The optional funtionalities that were given as an additional take to us were solved in this task usage, however mot perfect i really did do my best in the shortest tien fram that I had due to certain unfavourable conditions. Leaving that aside, I worked on the following:

- Html
- Css
- JavaScript
- and the optional tasks e.g

* Allow the user to specify what to use in replacing the words so that the app can do the scrambling with what the user provides, be it asterisks, question marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words.

* Display stats like how many words were scanned, how many matched the words to be scrambled, how many characters were scrambled in total, how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task etc.
